# Hotel-Management-Project
Using Java - OOP concept

This is a Hotel Management tool designed for customer management, room booking, food ordering, unbooking, and billing. It includes features to view room details and availability. The program operates through a menu-driven interface and runs until the user exits. Data persistence is ensured through file handling, saving customer, room, and food information on program exit. On restart, the program loads the saved data. File writing is implemented in a separate thread for parallel execution. Custom exceptions handle attempts to book already occupied rooms, and comprehensive exception handling addresses unexpected errors.
